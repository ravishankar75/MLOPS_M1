# M1: MLOps Foundations
## Objective: Understand the basics of MLOps and implement a simple CI/CD pipeline.
## Tasks:
	1.Set Up a CI/CD Pipeline:
	  + Use a CI/CD tool like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to set up a pipeline for a sample machine learning project.
	  + Include stages for linting, testing, and deploying a simple machine learning model.
	2.Version Control:
	  + Implement version control for your project using Git.
	  + Demonstrate branching, merging, and pull requests.
## Deliverables:
	1.A report detailing the CI/CD pipeline stages.
	2.Screenshots or logs showing successful runs of the pipeline.
	3.A Git repository link with branches and merge history.
